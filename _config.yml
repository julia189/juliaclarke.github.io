  Data Scientist with 4+ years experience in implementing productive Machine learnings models 
  optimizing business processes in After Sales, logistics and increasing sales conversions.<br/>
  I worked on projects automating warranty and repair claim processes, applied causal ML to evaluate actions taken on suppliers 
  and optimized the time point to contact potential and existing customers by using Survival analysis. 
  During these projects, I worked with vehicle diagnostics, configuration and location data, as well as 
  CRM, logistics, maintenance and warranty data. I am AWS certified and gained significant experience implemeting productive ML pipelines in the AWS cloud.

  Currently I am working for BMW and focusing on analytical optimization of campaigns
  by implementing Machine Learning models to personalize our targeting.
