#### Prediction of final taxi trip location
 Predicted final taxi trip location based on 442 taxi trips simulated in the city of Porto. Applied multi output neural network and mutli output regressor with an MSE of x%.

 Reframed problem as multiclass classification problem through clustering and predicting cluster with Random Forest regressor.
