#### Prediction of final taxi trip location
 Predicted final taxi trip location based on 442 taxi trips simulated in the city of Porto. Applied multi output neural network and mutli output regressor with an MSE of x%.

 Reframed problem as multiclass classification problem through clustering and predicting cluster with Random Forest regressor.

### Other projects 

#### PDF Data extraction with tasseract

#### Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) 

Master degree project to implement MILP model to optimize traffic flows in superblock layout city. Heatmap showcases traffic flow between individual blocks. Traffic flow is optimized between blocks and only remains high for blocks with centers (shopping centers, hospitals).
